The verse is condemning this belief and stating that it is false. Allah is described as having both hands wide open, spending as He wills, which means that He is generous and provides for His creation. The verse also speaks about the revelation that has been given to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and how it will increase some of the Jews in transgression and disbelief. This is because some of the Jews rejected the message of Islam and continued to hold onto their false beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the verse states that Allah has cast animosity and hatred among the People of the Book, which has led to conflict and war.
